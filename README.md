This project was to program a rock-paper-scissors game to be played via browser console. The brief was to create:
A function to randomly generate the 'computer' choice of rock, paper or scissors
A function to capture the user's choice (including remove case-sensitivity)
A function to compare the computer and user selections, score the round and display a message (win, lose or tie)
A function to play 5 rounds, score the game and display a message (win, lose or tie)
